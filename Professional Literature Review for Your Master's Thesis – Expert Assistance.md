## What is a Literature Review for a Master's Thesis?

A literature review is a crucial part of your Master's thesis. It provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of existing research on your chosen topic. The purpose of a literature review is to show that you have a deep understanding of the current state of research in your field. It also helps to establish a solid foundation for your own research, showing where your work fits within the broader academic conversation.

Creating a well-crafted literature review can take a significant amount of time and effort. It requires you to:

- Conduct thorough research to find relevant studies, articles, and papers.
- Analyze and synthesize information from various sources.
- Identify key themes, trends, and gaps in the existing literature.
